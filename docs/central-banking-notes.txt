## Theoretical Preface

The core precept of the Ion prototype is that there is a source of truth and finality which must witness
all payments it can keep a tally of the balances and enforce the rules. The security model of all
crypto-currencies rely on a source of validity and agreement on what validity is, usually by consensus of
many participants, to prove that history hasn't been tampered with. There are various other methods to
prevent history from being tampered with without it being easily detectable such as the rolling average
difficulty in the PoW mechanism employed by BitCoin which makes any divergence from the status quo an
expensive endeavour because it must overpower the inertia introduced by thousands of ASIC miners, but at
the same time it means that, regardless of how much energy you invest in Proof of Work, if you try to forge
history your attempts will be mostly ignored unless there is a trust relationship where the consumer of
the information doesn't perform their own verification (such as in the case of a 'light client'), or where
finality is a window where each transaction must be 'set in stone' by the mining of subsequent blocks...

However, I find that thinking about the security model is easier when the properties are reviewed within
the context of more general dichotomies, such as temporal, spacial and level of benevolence or participation,
to better understand the relationships between threats and also as a way of getting a deeper intuitive
understanding of the reasons for more general or specific design choices. The temporal categories are:
Future, Immediate and History; the spacial categories are: Local and Distant; and the adversaries are Neutral,
Malicious and Chaotic. For example, a local chaotic adversary which exists in the future is hard-drive failure.


## Trust at the point of consumption versus scalability

If you look at a program as a tree of decisions then every branch it takes relies on it knowing which
questions to ask and having to blindly depend on any answers it gets, then any component which retrieves
information from multiple sources ends up with the worst collective security properties from each one
and becomes the weakest link unless it independently verifies the information it consumes, but the more
information required for verification increases the amount of data which needs to be transmitted between
every participant. This scenario forms the basis of the axiom that trusted summaries are required to reduce
data transmission.

Whenever we consume information we trust that it has been verified at the point of origin to be correct in
terms of being honestly and accurately relayed without any attempt to deliberately deceive the consumer.
Cryptographic signatures, hashes, block-chains and consensus algorithms provide an additional layer of
assurance by allowing the collective us - participants of the system - to verify that we all have the same
information as everybody else as long as we trust a small handful of things we don't necessarily understand
and follow the actions described by others to meet a desire which originates from where?

From the perspective of a software designer and progressive logician I would prefer to have a system which
allows trustworthy properties such as non-repudibility and provenance to be relied upon whenever is necessary,
but in a way which doesn't impose a specific structure to my trust relationships and allows me to decide
on whatever I think a consensus is in order to be able to hedge against specific threats that I perceive.


## RSCoin, abstracted

RSCoin describes an incompatibilist approach which relies upon a system with a single trusted authority
which ultimately signs-off on everything as being the pinnacle standard for what is correct or not, but
in a distributed system consisting of thousands of nodes it comes with the presupposition that it should
define for us what trust is rather than simply that its structure and properties can be trusted. For RSCoin
to be truly trustable it must be distributed so each source of information can provide its own mechanisms
to verify its own reliability by co-proving that others are meeting the same or higher standards in a way
which enables the human-actors who decide what trust is to make their own choices when forming a consensus.

### If everybody was the 'Central Bank', then who would you trust? That should be the real question...

But, what is the purpose of a bank? Essentially it is to value assets, keep them in deposit, and provide
a proportionate fungible quantity of it available to you on-demand, or an item of exchangeable value. If
I were to get a mortgage for the value of my house the bank would be liable to provide something of equivalent
value, like honouring a cheque or card payment up to the limit of their liabilities or my overdraft.

However, how many levels of indirection are there between the above conception of 'bank' and the model
proposed by the RSCoin paper which adds an unnecessary 'centralised' requirement, it seems more like a
central validator node and single point of failure without the benefits of BitCoin segwit, where the
web-of-trust is imposed for our collective benefit without it being easy to opt-out regardless of whatever
the underlying technology can achieve.


## Non-repudibility is the enemy of privacy

And money is just a collective hallucination... but regardless of whatever it is there is a quantity
of it, either as a physical possession or a balance held with some entity which exists as a positive
or negative potential with an intuitive probability of being met.

Non-repudibility with a limit is used to determine the creditworthiness of somebody, every application
they make and significant event is correlated to one or more sources of truth about a specific account,
the credit rating agencies are implicitly provided with this information as per your agreement with
the lender. At the same time every dollar, pound or euro they provide in return is treated as equal
to each and every other unit of that currency in a fungible sense.

The case for involuntary non-repudibility is that evidence of your participation is available to others
to verify that your claims are true regardless of whether or not you lie. Each source of information
promotes the notion that it adheres to high standards and a set of rules which give it the distinctions
of being trustworthy and reputable - this requires a degree of impartiality and accepting corrections
to maintain accurate up to date information. Does keeping information disclosure voluntary provide any
less benefit to the parties involved in lending or other activities where trust is necessary compared
to enforced disclosure of all transactions and agreements between all parties.

But why should a system enforce one or another, or add specific properties which could be optional
depending on the use case. With a plurality of different systems with various properties unfortunately
the lowest common denominator often defines the highest level of security attainable.


## How have these insight guided Ion?

Instead of a hub and spoke architecture there are many hubs and spokes, where the architecture evolves
as a chaotic ecosystem of overlapping implementations, and amongst them they must find a harmonious
way to interoperate without unnecessary or artificial boundaries. Central Banking in a cryptocurrency
ecosystem extends further than where the coin is and who owns it, when the shared measure of value is
a currency like GBP, USD or EUR it is possible for policy to influence any parties which use it to
compare the value of one asset to another; as long as the 'Central Bank' policy has influence wherever
it needs to then why does it matter what the medium of exchange is?

The model that I think should be encouraged is to focus on the mechanism of exchange, the security
properties and trust relationships etc. and let the market determine what the best mediums are at
the point of exchange, where trust is a developing intuitive gauge rather than a package which we
are provided with, possibly even with a cost associated with it?

After distilling these ideas into their underlying mechanisms I've come to realise that all that matters
is a gaurantee that a provable history won't change. For example it isn't even necessary for the whole
blockchain to be stored if you can trust that any money you receive is backed by a redeemable
asset upon proof of your interest in it - like the note in your hand, as long as at the point of exchange
the recipient can be assured of it being easily exchangeable into whatever their preferences are for
storage of value is on the terms they would prefer...

A good rule of thumb would be: never depend on any single entity which could cause the entire system
to fail, but without the implications of the SkyNet or HAL scenarios etc.
