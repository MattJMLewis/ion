# bilateral atomic swap

one way to implement them is to have a condition or prerequesite flag 

this means the transaction can sit in the mempool for as long as it's valid
however it won't be included in a block unless all of the transactions it
depends on exist.

for example:

 I submit payment X which is contingent on payment Y being sent.
 Payment Y will only be sent if payment X exists.

Payment X dependent on Y
Payment Y dependent on X

However, both have valid signatures and are submitted for a specific block.

But if neither has all dependencies at the point of finalisation, it won't get
committed...

This could be an additional flag on the payment, 'dependent ref', however it doesn't include any other information like the payment, destination or currency...

The simplest conditional is the transaction id (which excludes the signature), this means the counterparty must submit a payment of the exact specification otherwise both will be dropped.

however, is it necessary to create multiple dependent payments
